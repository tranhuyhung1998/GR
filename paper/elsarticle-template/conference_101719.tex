\begin{abstract}
In wireless sensor networks, a sensor node senses the environment to get data and send them to the sink or base station via a single hop or multi-hop. The applications for this vary in numerous fields such as military, agriculture, smart home, and industry. Due to the limited resources, the construction of a good routing path to prolong the network lifetime is an important problem. One of the approaches is using data aggregation techniques to save energy consumption. Maximizing the lifetime of a data-gathering tree has been proved to be NP-hard. 
In this paper, we study the problem of constructing a data aggregation tree for four objectives: total energy consumption, network lifetime, latency and noise. We propose a genetic-based algorithm to solve the problem. Experimental validations on our benchmarks have been carried out to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.
